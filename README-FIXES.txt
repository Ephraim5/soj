STREAMS OF JOY - FIX PACKAGE
---------------------------

What I prepared for you:
- babel.config.js  -- a corrected Babel config that includes NativeWind and module-resolver aliases.
- apply_fixes.cmd  -- Windows CMD script to apply the change and run common cleanup/install commands.
- apply_fixes.ps1  -- PowerShell script equivalent.
- README (this file) -- instructions and safe commands to run locally.

How to use (recommended):
1) BACKUP your project folder (always do this first).
2) Copy these files into your project root (the same folder as package.json). For example:
   - copy babel.config.js into C:\Users\JOJO\Downloads\StreamsOfJoyManagement\StreamsOfJoyManagment\
   - copy apply_fixes.cmd and apply_fixes.ps1 there as well.

3) Open a CMD (or PowerShell) **as Administrator** (helps avoid EPERM issues with cache cleanup), then run:
   CMD:
     apply_fixes.cmd
   PowerShell (if needed):
     .\apply_fixes.ps1

What the scripts do:
- Back up your existing babel.config.js to babel.config.js.bak (if present).
- Copy the corrected babel.config.js into your project root.
- Attempt to uninstall known problematic packages that expo-doctor flags:
    @types/react-native, @expo/prebuild-config, @expo/config-plugins, react-native-modern-datepicker
  (If they are not installed, npm will skip them.)
- Install babel-plugin-module-resolver as a dev dependency (so TS path aliases work at runtime).
- Clean npm cache, reinstall node_modules, run expo-doctor, and leave instructions to start with cache cleared.

Manual command summary (if you prefer to run commands yourself):
(From project root)
  npm cache clean --force
  npm uninstall --no-save @types/react-native @expo/prebuild-config @expo/config-plugins react-native-modern-datepicker
  npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-module-resolver
  npm install
  npx expo-doctor
  npx expo start -c

Notes & Explanation:
- I did NOT run npm install automatically here (no network / to avoid changing your environment). The scripts will run it on your machine.
- If you have a slow/unstable network, try increasing npm timeouts:
  pnpm config set fetch-timeout 60000
  pnpm config set fetch-retries 5
  pnpm config set fetch-retry-factor 10

If you want, I can also prepare a fully patched project ZIP where I replaced babel.config.js in your repo. But to avoid changing too much automatically, I left the fix as a small package you can apply safely.
